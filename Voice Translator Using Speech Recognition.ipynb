    "# **Voice Translator Using Speech Recognition**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Introduction**\n",
    "This project implements a **Speech-to-Speech Translator**, which captures spoken input, transcribes it into text, translates it into a target language, and converts the translated text back into speech. This system demonstrates the integration of speech recognition, language translation, and text-to-speech synthesis, making it a useful tool for real-time communication across languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Objective**\n",
    "To develop a Python-based tool that bridges language barriers by leveraging libraries like SpeechRecognition, GoogleTrans, and pyttsx3.\n",
